‚Ä¢ You can use me to set the group rules
‚Ä¢ I have a flexible *anti-flood* system
‚Ä¢ I can *welcome new users* with a customizable message, or if you want with a gif or a sticker
‚Ä¢ I can *warn* users, and ban them when they reach the maximum number of warnings
‚Ä¢ I can also warn, kick or ban users when they post a specific media

To work properly, it needs to be admin in your group, so it can kick or ban people if needed.
Only the group owner can promote it :)

You can use `/, ! or #` to trigger a command.

Group Butler saves the adminlist of a group in its databse to avoid to send too many requests to Telegram.
This list is updated every 5 hours, so there could be some differences between who the bot thinks are the admins and who the admins actually are, if during the 5 hours timeframe some users have been promoted/demoted.
It's possible to force the bot to update its adminlist with `/cache`.

Remember: you have to use commands  *in the group*, unless they are specifically designed for private chats (see "private" tab).]]), -- luacheck: ignore 631

‚Ä¢ `/about` : show some useful informations about the bot

*Note*: `/dashboard`, `/adminlist` and `/staff` always reply in private. If the bot is unable to reach a user, it will ask in the group to that user to be started, but just if _silent mode_ is off.
With `/rules`, the bot always answer in the group for admins, but with normal users the message is sent in the group or in private according to the group settings.

‚Ä¢ `@admin` (by reply): report a message to the admins of the group (the bot will forward it in prvate). This ability could be turned off from the group settings. A description of the report can be added.

For a correct use of the markdown, check this post in the channel

If you are going to use it in a public supergroup, you do not need to append the group link. Just send `/setlink`

A set of commands that let admins kick and ban people from a group, and get some information about a user.
Kicked people can join back, banned people can't. Banned users are added to the group's blacklist. It's possible to blacklist users even if they are not part of the group.
Only the administrators who have the permission to restrict users can use these commands, but `/status` can be used by all the admins.

‚Ä¢ `/kick [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: kick a user from the group.
‚Ä¢ `/ban [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: ban a user from the group.
‚Ä¢ `/tempban [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: ban a user for a specific amount of time. Use the returned keyboard to ban the user.
Pass a value on a new line to use it as starting value. When a ban expires, the user won't be added back. Check the Telegram's restricted users list for pending unbans.
‚Ä¢ `/fwdban [by reply]`: ban the original sender of a forwarded message.
‚Ä¢ `/unban [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: unban the user from the group.

Will also show the permissions the user *doesn't* have.

If on, the antiflood system will kick/ban flooders.

*Note*: goodbye messages don't work in large groups. This is a Telegram limitation that can't be avoided.

*Custom welcome message*:
‚Ä¢ `/welcome Welcome $name, enjoy the group!`
Write after `/welcome` your welcome message. `/goodbye` works in the same way.

As you may know, the bot can warn/kick/ban who sends a telegram.me link (antispam settings) or any other link (media settings).
The whitelist is a list of links that will be ignored by the bot.
If users send a whitelisted link, they won't be warned or kicked.

`/whitelist [link(s)]` or `/wl [link(s)]`: add one or more links to the whitelist.
`/unwhitelist [link(s)]` or `/unwl [link(s)]`: remove one or more links from the whitelist.
`/whitelist` or `/wl`: get the whitelist.
`/whitelistl -` or `/wl -`: empty the whitelist.

When the group link is saved with `/setlink`, it gets automatically added to the whitelist.

You can reply to a media (_photo, file, vocal, video, gif, audio_) with `/extra #yourtrigger` to save the #extra and receive that media each time you use # command
‚Ä¢ `/extra list`: get the list of your custom commands.

		warns = i18n([[*Warns*
Warn are made to keep the count of the admonitions received by a user. Once users have been warned for the defined number of times, they are kicked/banned by the bot.
There are two different type of warns:
- _normal warns_, given by an admin with the `/warn` command
- _automatic warns_ (read: media warns and spam warns), given by the bot when someone sends a media that is not allowed in the chat, or spams other channels or telegram.me links.

‚Ä¢ `/warn [by reply]`: warn a user
‚Ä¢ `/sw`: you can place a `/sw` (_"silent warn"_) everywhere you want in your message. The bot will silently count the warn, but won't answer in the group unless the user reached the max. number of warnings.
‚Ä¢ `/nowarns [by reply]`: reset the warns received by a user (both normal and automatic warns).
‚Ä¢ `/warnmax [number]`: set the max number of the warns before the kick/ban.
‚Ä¢ `/warnmax media [number]`: set the max number of the warns before kick/ban when an unallowed media is sent.

How to see how many warns a user has received (or to reset them): `/user` command.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed: `/config` command, then `menu` button.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed for medias: `/config` command, then `media` button.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed for spam: `/config` command, then `antispam` button.]]),

The "48 hours limit" to edit your own messages doesn't apply to bots.
This command was born from the necessity of editing the pinned message without sending it again, maybe just to change few things.
So with `/pin` you can generate a message to pin, and edit it how many times you want.

‚Ä¢ `/pin [text]`: the bot will send you back the text you used as argument, with markdown. You can pin the message and use `/pin [text]` again to edit it
‚Ä¢ `/pin`: the bot will find the latest message generate by `/pin`, if it still exists
‚Ä¢ `/newpin [text]`: forces the bot to send another message that will be saved as new target for `/pin`

*Note*: `/pin` supports markdown, but only `$rules` and `$title` placeholders]]),
		lang = i18n([[*Group language*
‚Ä¢ `/lang`: change the bot language (works on groups and private chats)

You can help improve translations on our Crowdin Project

*Special characters*

‚Ä¢ `/config` command, then `menu` button: you will receive in private the menu keyboard.
Here you will find two particular options: _Arab and RTL_.

*Arab*: when Arab is not allowed (üö´), people who write Arab characters will be kicked from the group.
*Rtl*: stands for 'Right To Left' character, is the cause of weird service messages written in the opposite direction.
When Rtl is not allowed (üö´), people who write Rtl characters (or have it in their names) will be kicked.]]),

`/config` or  `/settings`: manage the group settings in private from an inline keyboard.

*Media*: choose which media to forbid in your group, and set the number of times that a user will be warned before being kicked/banned
*Antispam*: choose which kind of message you want to forbid (e.g. telegram.me links, forwarded messages from channels)
*Log channel*: choose which updates should be logged

*Bonus commands*:
`/reportflood [number of messages]/[timeframe]`: set how many times users can use the @admin command within a certain timeframe.
`/leave`: the bot will leave the group without deleting its data. Use this command only if you are going to add the bot to the group again

		logchannel = i18n([[*Log channel informations*

A log channel is a _(private)_ channel where the bot will record all the important events that will happen in your group.
If you want to use this feature, you need to pair your group with a channel with the commands described below.
All the events, by default, are *not logged*. Admins can choose which events to log from the `/config` menu -> `log channel` button.

To pair a channel with a group, the *channel creator* must [add the bot to the channel administrators](telegram.me/gb_tutorials/4) (otherwise it won't be able to post), and send in the channel this command:
`/setlog`
Then, an admin of the group must forward in the group the message ("`/setlog`") sent in the channel. *Done*!
(you can find a video-tutorial [here](https://telegram.me/GB_tutorials/8))

A channel can be used as log by different groups.
To change your log channel, simply repeat this process with another channel.

`/unsetlog`: remove your current log channel
`/logchannel`: get some informations about your log channel, if paired]]),
